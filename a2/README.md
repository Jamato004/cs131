# datacollector.sh â€” CS 131 Assignment 2

## What This Script Does

`datacollector.sh` is a shell script that automates the process of downloading and summarizing **CSV datasets** from a user-provided URL. It supports datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and handles ZIP archives that contain one or more CSV files.

It performs the following tasks:

- Downloads a CSV file or ZIP archive containing CSVs
- Extracts all CSV files from the archive
- Automatically detects the delimiter by checking common options: `,`, `;`, `\t`, `|`, `:`
- Lists the feature (column) names for each CSV
- Prompts the user to identify which columns are numerical
- Calculates **min**, **max**, **mean**, and **standard deviation** for each selected numerical column using `awk`
- Creates a Markdown summary file for each CSV: `summary_<filename>.md`
- Cleans up temporary files after execution

## How to Use It

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your script's folder.

2. Run the script with Bash:
   ```bash
   bash datacollector.sh
   ```

3. When prompted:

    * Paste in a URL to a dataset (e.g. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/186/wine+quality.zip)

    * Review the list of features shown

    * Enter the column numbers (indices) of the numerical columns (e.g. 1,2,3)

4. The script will:

    * Download and extract the ZIP file (if applicable)

    * Detect the delimiter (from common delimiters)

    * List the feature names

    * Prompt you to identify the numeric columns

    * Generate summary.md containing:

        * The feature list

        * A table of min, max, mean, and standard deviation for selected numeric columns
